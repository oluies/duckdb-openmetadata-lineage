-- Country-agnostic calendar dimension. Holds NO holiday columns;
-- "is X a holiday in country Y" is answered by joining
-- fct_holiday_calendar on date_key + country_code.
--
-- iso_day_of_week uses DuckDB's isodow() which always returns
-- 1 (Monday) .. 7 (Sunday) and is INDEPENDENT of any
-- SET DATEFIRST / locale setting. iso_year + iso_year_week follow
-- ISO 8601 too: 2025-12-29 -> iso_year=2026, iso_year_week='2026-W01'.
--
-- ISO 8601 is the week convention for Sweden, the EU and most
-- trading use. us_week_number carries the US/Sunday-start
-- convention (strftime %U) for consumers that need it: weeks start
-- Sunday and days before the first Sunday of the year fall in
-- "week 0", so its range is 0..53. Unlike ISO, US weeks never
-- cross the year boundary (2023-12-31 -> week 53 of 2023), so there
-- is no separate US week-year column; year_number already holds it.
--
-- ML feature columns (cycle-position booleans, distance ints,
-- sin/cos cyclical encodings) live alongside the standard dim
-- columns so feature-engineering pipelines can read straight from
-- this one table without re-deriving from date_day.
